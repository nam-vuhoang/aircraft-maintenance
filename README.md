# Aircraft Maintenance

This proof-of-concept project provides the backend and frontend services for visualizing aircraft flights and maintenance work packages in a timeline component. The backend is built with NestJS, TypeORM, and TypeScript. The frontend is built with Vite, React, and TypeScript. Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. The services are containerized using Docker and can be easily set up using Docker Compose.

This project was assigned to me by **QOCO** as a job seeker challenge. This document describes how to install and use the web application and explains the various aspects of how I approached and solved this challenge.
