# Requirement Analysis and Assumptions

## Functional Requirements

The task requires building a full-stack application that implements a timeline view to display data on flights and maintenance tasks (work packages). The time range at the top of the timeline view should be rendered dynamically with hourly and daily time units. Additionally, the timeline should have scrolling and zooming features.

The backend should provide a RESTful API for `GET` operations on these resources.

### Additional Features

To enhance the functionality of the application, I have added the following features:

1. **Timeline View with Multiple Time Ruler Options:**

   - Given that the time range to be displayed can vary from a few hours to several months, users should be able to select time ruler formats, such as Days + Hours (on the top and bottom rows) or Months + Weeks + Days.
   - The timeline view should automatically zoom in or out depending on the time ruler format and the window size.

2. **RESTful API with Full CRUD Operations:**

   - This feature allows for the creation, updating, and deletion of flights and work packages.
   - The RESTful API should also support the import of batch data in the same JSON format as the sample files included in the project assignment.
   - Additionally, it should provide the ability to retrieve lists of unique registration numbers, stations, and other data to quickly build multi-select controllers on the UI.
   - The backend should expose Swagger documentation for the RESTful API.

3. **Import Page:**

   - This feature helps users add new flights and work packages to the application for testing.

4. **Flight and Work Package Pages:**
   - These pages help users see data in table format and verify it.
   - They were implemented separately because flights and work packages have different data fields.

### Constraints and Assumptions

1. **Data Validation:**

   - The application validates only data types to maintain data integrity.
   - It does not validate data values, such as checking for overlapping flights.
   - When creating data, it does not check whether items with the same IDs already exist. Instead, it automatically overwrites existing data (if any). In other words, importing the same JSON file multiple times does not change the data.

2. **Pagination and Sorting:**

   - Pagination and sorting features are currently not supported due to time constraints.

3. **Updating and Deleting Data:**
   - The application does not support updating or deleting data in the UI. If needed, updating and deleting single objects can be done via the backend API using their unique IDs.

### Non-functional Requirements

1. No non-functional constraints (e.g., data amount, performance, memory consumption) were mentioned in the task assignment. These constraints, if any, could impact the software design solutions.

2. Therefore, we assume that the amount of data is not too large, and, for example, caching data is not required.
